            former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi has said he is more
             qualified to lead Nigeria than Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and former Lagos governor, Bola Tinubu.
             The former minister resigned from President Muhammadu Buhari’s cabinet to pursue his 
             presidential ambition under the platform of the APC.  
        </p>

        <p>
            Amaechi said this on Wednesday during his visit to Kano as part of his consultations ahead of 
            the All Progressives Congress’ presidential primary election.

        <p>
            Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, during the meeting, however, refused to endorse Amaechi.
 
Ganduje, believed to be supporting Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s ambition,
 said Kano as a “swing state, will continue to swing until the end, so try and be part of the swings”.
 
He added that Amaechi would know where the state eventually swings to at the appropriate time.
        </p>

            Meanwhile, the former minister said he was more qualified than Tinubu, noting that the former Lagos governor had never been a minister, and even as a lawmaker, Tinubu only served for a few months.
 
            He stated that he was more qualified than Vice President Yemi Osinbajo because while Osinbajo was a commissioner in Lagos, he was already a Speaker of Rivers State House of Assembly.

            However, Ganduje commended Amaechi for his endearing efforts in standing with the APC and fighting for it in the wee hours of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidency.

He said, “We are aware of how you suffered for our party at the ‘mega movement’ stage of its formation, as Buhari’s campaign director.”
