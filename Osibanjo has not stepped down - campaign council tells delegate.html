            Vice President Yemi Osinbajo Presidential campaign council on Sunday dismissed a report that the Vice President has stepped down 
            from the presidential race ahead of the primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC) coming up on Monday and Tuesday.
        </p>

        <p>
            Reports being circulated had claimed that the vice president 
            met yesterday in Abuja to deliberate on presenting a consensus candidate for the region.

            However, a statement published by  Richard Akinola, Chairman, PYO Media Council told delegates of the ruling APC that news that Osinbajo has stepped is fake news.

            He said, “…we implore you to kindly disregard various fake news making the rounds that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has stepped down.”

            “The purveyors of this fake news are afraid of the huge political support base of Vice President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.”

“Please note that no such action is being contemplated. Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is the leading aspirant, as attested to by the report of the party’s screening committee. 
He is ready for the primaries and very sure of his victory.”
