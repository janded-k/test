            Mr Tinubu and his running mate, Kashim Shettima, of the all progressive congress
             met with the leadership of the student body on Thursday in Ososgbo, Osun State.
        </p>

        <p>
            He said he decided to intervene following a recent comment by President Muhammadu Buhari on the strike.

“We were trying to find—even if it is back door, 
a way of reaching them. I am assuring you, we are not going to use back door because our leader too— Buhari has shown his lamentation in the last 48hours and as a result of that, he has left the door open for our intervention,” Mr Tinubu said.
        </p>

        <p>
            He continued that NANS under his leadership is now willing to do whatever it takes to make sure the students return back to classes.

“We have reached a stage in this struggle where the end is more important to us than the means and as leaders we will not do less than our very best to ensure the end of the strike.”

        </p>

        <p>
            Mr Buhari, on Tuesday, while meeting with some governors of the APC, legislators and political leaders at his residence in Daura, Katsina State, 
            said the lingering industrial action will have “generational consequences on families, the educational system and future development of the country.”
        </p>
        <p>
            After the meeting, Tinubu was endorsed by NANS as the presidential candidate for 2023.
