            At a Breakfast and Media Session titled, “Why I Am Running for President”, organised by Saraki Support Group in Abuja, the former Senate President said if elected,
            he will be President for all, and be a bridge between two counterparts.

            He also stated that he will be the bridge between the young and the old, private sector and public sector, I will be the bridge between Muslims and Christians. I will be the bridge between the North and the South. because I am the Nigerian for all Nigerians,”   
        </p>

        <p>
            he, however, said as long as there is a child in Nigeria that cannot read or write, then the job is not done.  
        </p>

        <p>
            “And it is for this one child that I want to run for President because I will ensure that the law on compulsory basic education is enforced and quality of teaching improves in all public schools,” he said.
        </p>

        <p>
            He also acknowledged that the nation has experienced setbacks in the last couple of years
        </p>

        <p>
            “2023 presents the moment to choose hope over hopelessness; the moment to choose peace and security over fear and terror; the moment to choose unity and inclusion over division and exclusion; the moment that we draw a bold line in the sands of history and say, ‘no more’ and then move ahead as one people, as one nation, towards our God-assigned destiny as the greatest black nation on the face of the earth,” he added.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the statement of Saraki Campaign Council chairman, Prof. Iyorwuese Hagher, described the immediate-past Senate President as “a real change maker”, saying if elected as 
            President in 2023, he will restore stability in Nigeria.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hagher said Saraki will “give Nigerians, not the change from the top to the bottom, but the real change we wanted in 2015 to live in peace, pursue life, liberty, and happiness and be guaranteed security, prosperity and good health.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Speaking further, he said: “In Bukola you are witnessing a social movement in Nigeria when, (I paraphrase Dr. Luther King Jr.) ‘Nigerians are ready to elect their President, Judged by the content of his/her political achievements and vision and not by his tribal origin, what language he speaks, and his faiths.'”
