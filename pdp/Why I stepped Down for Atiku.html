            Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, has revealed reasons why he stepped down his presidential ambition for the support of Atiku Abubakar at the day of presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party.  
        </p>

        <p>
            The governor said it is what he learnt from his leaders in the past and that it is good of all Nigerians.
        </p>

        <p>
            The governor stated this while addressing a crowd who welcomed him back at the state government house on Friday shortly after his arrival from Abuja.  
        </p>

        <p>
            Tambuwal said, “Thank you very much our leaders and distinguished supporters from all over the country for your support and cooperation. I must thank leaders of our party here at Sokoto State level and every level.
        </p>

        <p>
            “What we have done is for the good of our party and the country. I appreciate everyone of you that prayed for me and our party. The sacrifice that I have made on your behalf is aimed at strengthening our party, our democracy, and, by the grace of God, soft landing our polity.

            This is in consonance with the teachings of our leaders and the [emulation] of the examples they have given to us in the past: that we must continue to make sacrifice for the good of all of us and our country. 
        </p>

        <p>
            “I thank the people of Sokoto State and all my supporters across the country for their support. Rest assured, we shall work assiduously for the victory of our party come 2023 general election.”
