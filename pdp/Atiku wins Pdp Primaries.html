            Twelve candidates took part in the contest following the stepping down of Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, 
            withdrawal of Dr Nwachukwu Anakwenze for wike and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen. 

        </p>

        <p>

        <p>
            In his acceptance speech, Atiku pledged to correct the misdeeds that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) had brought to the country. 

        </p>

        <p>
            Today, we are making another history which we believe will bring about fundamental changes in our electoral process. 
            Today marks another milestone in the process to consolidate our democratic gains. You will recall that on the 23rd of March when I declared my interest to run. In that statement, I made a commitment to five issues. 
        </p>

        <p>
            One is to unify this country and that was why I called myself a unifier. And I think unity is important to us because the government of the APC has disunited the country completely. I also submit- ted that I was going to deal decisively with our security and economic challenges all caused by the APC government. 
        
        </p>

        <p>
            The PDP once made Nigeria the most viable economy in the African continent, but the APC came and wiped out all the gains. But we have to move and rise up to change the status quo. 

            “And I am ready to cooperate with every member in my party to deepen the democratic process in our party to get it to a level that it can take over the government. 
          
        </p>

        <p>
            Let me appeal to our party members to make use of the internal mechanism inherent in our party to resolve the disputes within the party.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please, in the name of Allah, let us work together to resolve most of our challenges if not all,” he said.
