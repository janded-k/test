            The governor spoke during the inauguration of the Rivers State House of Assembly Quarters, an estate tastefully completed by his administration to provide befitting accommodation for the state lawmakers.
        </p>

        <p>
            The project was inaugurated by House of Representatives Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila.

            Wike on his speech said, "People have said I went to court against Atiku Abubakar. I want to say categorically that if I had a reason to go to court I will go to court. But I didn’t go to court. I just have to say it for Nigerians to know.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I have kept quiet and busy delivering the dividends of democracy for my party to win election; people are busy plotting how they will win election, but others are busy trying to see how they will lose election.

            If they lose the election nobody should call my name. I have told the candidate, you will lose this election and you will win this election because of people around you. Anybody who knows me knows that if I was going to court , I would have gone to court within two weeks after the primaries because it is a pre-election matter and after two weeks you can’t go to the court.
        </p>

        <p>
            “The legal adviser of the party called me and I told him you know there is mischief going on;  you know me very well if I am going to court it is not those kind of lawyers I would have used and I don’t even know the lawyers. I want to tell the candidate (Atiku) that it is his group that is doing all these things. Let the world hear.
