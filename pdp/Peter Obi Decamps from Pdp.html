        <p>Peter Obi a former Anambra state governor and presidential aspirant, has left the 
            Peoples Democratic Party. He left the party less than  three days to its presidential primary election.
        </p>

        <p>
            An aide to the former governor confirmed his exit from the party. He dismissed speculations that Mr Obi is pulling out of the presidential race thus suggesting that Peter Obi may contest on another party’s platform.
        </p>

        <p>
            In a letter posted on his twitter account on why left he says 
            recent developments within our party make it practically impossible to continue participating and making such constructive contributions.
            The letter reads:
        </p>

        <p>
            “I am writing to intimate you of my resignation from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which was conveyed to the Chairman of Agulu Ward 2. Anaocha LGA of
            Anambra, effective Friday 20 May, 2022. Consequently, am by this letter informing you of my withdrawal for the PDP Presidential Primaries.

It has been a great honour to contribute to nation-building efforts through our party. Unfortunately, recent developments within our party make it practically impossible to continue participating and making such constructive contributions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our national challenges are deep-seated and require that we each make profound sacrifices towards rescuing our country. My commitment to rescuing Nigeria remains firm, even if the route differs.

“I wish to thank you personally for your graciousness and leadership. I wish you well and best of luck in the service of country.“
        </p>
