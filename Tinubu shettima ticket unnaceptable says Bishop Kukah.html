        <p>
            The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto diocese, Matthew Hassan Kukah has condemned the All Progressives Congress, choice of Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket.
        </p>

        <p>
            On his interview with Channels Television on Thursday, he said the decision of the apc is not good for 
            National integration.
        </p>

        <p>
            He said: “But moving forward, the question I have asked my friends who are Muslims, especially those who are from northern Nigeria, is a simple question: ‘Would Muslims in Nigeria or northern Nigeria be ready to make the same concession that Christians made in 1984 and 1993?

“I think that as a Christian, this is totally reprehensible. It is not acceptable to me, but that is the decision of the APC as a party. Perhaps, when the campaign starts, we will hear what people have to say.”
