            The former Governor of Rivers State, Rotimi Amaechi, has alleged that some delegates were induced with money to vote at the APC presidential primary in June.

Mr Amaechi made the allegation on Saturday at an event to mark the 60th birthday of Eugene Ogu, the general overseer of Abundant Life Evangel Mission in Port Harcourt.

            He added that some of the delegates that collected money to vote are regretting their decisions.

“God should save the ordinary Nigerian because they are the problem. Those who voted at the APC primary, who are they? 
The ordinary Nigerian. The small money they got solved their immediate problems,” he said.

            Speaking on the outcome of the primary election, Mr Amaechi said those who voted at the primaries are ordinary Nigerians and who he believed are the problem of Nigeria.

“I don’t believe that is the solution to Nigeria’s problem — giving money. I hope you know. If I give you N10 million now and when it finishes, what happens? The solution to Nigeria’s problem is that all of you must rise,” he said.

“Now ‘oh we made a mistake’; ‘we didn’t make a mistake’. We are hearing different things. If Nigeria’s problem were to be solved, the ordinary Nigerian must be at the forefront. Pray for the leadership of the country, but also pray that ordinary Nigerians choose the right president to govern.

 I am not joking — may God make you vote for the right candidate that will change Nigeria,” he said.
