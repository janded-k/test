            he presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has urged his Labour Party counterpart, Peter Obi, to caution his supporters from spreading lies about him
        </p> 

        <p>
            In a press statement by Bayo Onanuga, the Director of Media and Communications, in the Tinubu Campaign Organisation, the politician warned that “falsehood and disinformation will not win elections.”

            “The Tinubu Campaign Organisation has appealed to the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi to call his supporters to order and to allow this election circle to be about issues that will advance the growth, 
            progress and stability of Nigeria,” the statement said.   
        </p>

        <p>
            Mr Bayo Onanuga’s statement came after a false report purporting that Ghana’s 
            President Nana Akufo-Addo wrote a letter to Mr Tinubu, asking him to support Peter Obi and focus on his health.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mr Akufo-Addo denounced the development via his official Twitter account, saying it was a product of deliberate mischief with the intent to deceive the public.

“I have written no such letter to the APC leader, and it will not occur to me to do so. Ghana and Nigeria boast of decades of cordial, strong and brotherly relations, and I am not going to be the one to 
interfere in the internal affairs and politics of Nigeria,”
