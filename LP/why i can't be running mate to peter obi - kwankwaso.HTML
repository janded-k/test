                A former Governor of Kano State and Presidential Candidate of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso, has explained why he cannot be running mate to the Presidential
                 Candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi. He made this known on sunday night july 3, 2022
                 while appearing on a Channels Television Programme, Sunday Politics.  
            </p>

            <p>
               He said that it will be difficult for the Northern voters to vote for a presidential candidate from the South-East because they are not comfortable with most of the 
                things happening in the South, especially in the South East.
            </p>

            <p>
                He said, “I believe it is in the interest of Labour Party and the NNPP, and even in the interest of this country … because LP, as it stands today, certainly cannot win election. Yes! It cannot win elections.

                “Because mainly, the support is mainly in a particular zone and not spread, and the figures there cannot earn anybody a presidential seat in this country.” 
            </p>

            <h3>He Said Peter Obi should accept to be his running mate</h3>

            <p>
                He said, “The major issue, as it stands today, is the issue of who becomes the president and who becomes the vice president and I believe this is the time really to advise – especially those who are positively behind the candidate of the Labour Party – that for me, I have seen an opportunity for the South East to be relevant in the next dispensation. In PDP, they are completely out, 
                and so in the APC. The only opportunity now is the NNPP. 
            </p>

            <p>
                ’You see Northern voter is the worst hit on this issue of maladministration in this country, but even under that circumstances, a northern voter believes he is better off under one united Nigeria and now most of the things that are happening in the South, especially in the South-East; people are not comfortable with that and as long as you have somebody from there in any party, it will be very difficult for the northern voters to vote, and that’s the situation now.
            </p>

            <p>
                On whether he can be running mate to Peter Obi, Kwankwaso said, ‘’Ordinarily, I am jobless now. I am not doing any job now. But to become a vice president, if anybody from the Southeast under this circumstance becomes the presidential candidate of our party or any other party, the implication is that because of activities and many other issues that are real on the ground, Northern voters will certainly go for northern candidates in another party.

So the thinking is that is not whether I like it or I don’t like it, the facts remain that everybody will lose. He will lose, I will lose.”
