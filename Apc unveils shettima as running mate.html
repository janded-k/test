            This was done after choice of muslim - muslim ticket caused an uproar among the People of the country mostly christians.

            During the unveiling ceremony were bishops who Nigerians believed to be fake. The reasons being that christians in the country 
            have rejected Tinubu's choice of Vp as no christians leader would want to be seen at the event.
