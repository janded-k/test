            The All Progressives Congress Presidential Candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu
            on Sunday in Daura, said he chose former Borno State Governor, Kashim Shettima, as his running mate because he is “competent and reliable”.

        <p>
            Tinubu said this shortly after he visited the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at his Daura home in Katsina State.

Speaking shortly after a closed-door session with the President, he explained why he chose Shettima as running mate saying, “I chose him because he is competent, capable and reliable.”
        </p>

        <p>
            On the aim of his visit, he said “We came to pay homage to him (Buhari) and to share part of his holiday and lunch. And to discuss the question of my substantive running mate .
        </p>

        <p>
           When Asked about his party’s chances in next year’s presidential elections, the former Lagos State governor said, “We are going to win Insha Allah. Because we are a progressive party. We have the focus on the Nigerian problems and we face the challenge squarely and we’re not running away from it. We have a better programme for the people and about the people and we are ready to serve.
