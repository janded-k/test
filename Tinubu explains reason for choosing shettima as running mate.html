           When Asked about his party’s chances in next year’s presidential elections, the former Lagos State governor said, “We are going to win Insha Allah. Because we are a progressive party. We have the focus on the Nigerian problems and we face the challenge squarely and we’re not running away from it. We have a better programme for the people and about the people and we are ready to serve.
